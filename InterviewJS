redux which is just a state management tool
const a ={
value:'Hello'
}
const b ={
value:'World'
}
console.log(a+b); //"objectobject"
console.log(a.value+b.value); //"HelloWorld"

The right answer to this question is
"objectobject"

Explanation:
In #javascript, when you try to concatenate objects using the + operator, they are converted to strings. This conversion involves calling the toString() method on each object. 
Since both a and b are objects (not strings), their toString() methods are called, resulting in "[object Object][object Object]". 
Therefore, the output of console.log(a + b); will be "objectobject".
Now, if you want to modify the behavior so that the output becomes "HelloWorld" , how would you achieve that without directly manipulating the toString() method of the objects a and b?
